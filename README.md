## Ben Butterworth
> Journalist writing about tech and society

### Who am I?

Hi, there, welcome to my GitHub page! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Ben and I write about the social impact of science and technology. Here is where I store my coding projects. 

This is also where I put "behind the scenes" stuff about the articles I write, like bibliographies and sources. Why do I put that on GitHub? Because I believe you should be able to make an informed choice about whether or not you trust what I say. Good journalism is about accuracy, accountability and clarity, and putting my methods online lets you check if I obey those principles. Don't trust me - audit me.

### What am I working on right now?
1. I'm trying to figure out a winning strategy for the board game Othello based on years of World Championship games (`OthelloScope`).
2. I'm getting an automated web-scraper ready for production for Diabetologia (where I work) to generate their weekly newsletter (`auto-etoc`).
3. I'm also making a guide to making software tools for people who, like me, never did any computer science training.

### I'm a beginner!
Reach out and teach me something! I want to learn more about everything I'm doing, so if you see me miss an important perspective, make a mistake or you just want to give advice, please contact me!
