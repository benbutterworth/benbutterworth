## Ben Butterworth
Hi, there, welcome to my GitHub page! 👋 

### Who am I?
I'm Ben and I'm teaching myself how to design and code great software tools.

### What am I working on right now?
1. I'm maintaining a web-scraper, `auto-etoc`, that helps generate Diabetologia's weekly newsletter.
2. I'm learning `go` with some small projects like a password generator `dgenerate` and a [steganographic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography) image manipulation tool, `stego`.
3. I'm also designing a CLI program that'll help me organise my writing projects by generating an interactive index of keywords.

### I'm a beginner!
Software isn't my background, so this is all new to me! I'm loving getting stuck in even though I feel out of my depth. I want to cut my teeth working alongside great people, so don't be afraid to reach out and tell me what I can be doing better!
